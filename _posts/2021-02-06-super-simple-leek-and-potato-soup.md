My daughter absolutely LOVES soup. It's such an easy way to get a variety of veggies into her. As she's still quite little I toast half a slice of seeded bread, cut it up into cubes and then pour the soup all over it. She can't get enough.

Most leek and potato soups on the internet are full of salt and ingredients that my little one unfortunately can't have. However this one is really really simple and delicious! _(CONFESSION: I add salt to my bowl! My halo is not that shiny!)_

### Ingredients

- 500g leeks
- knob unsalted butter
- 500g potatoes
- 500ml vegetable stock (made with 1 low salt chicken stock cube)
- 200ml whole milk

### Method

1. Slice the leeks up and heat in a pan with the butter on a low heat for about 5 minutes.
2. Meanwhile peel and chop the potatoes.
3. Add to the pan with the stock and cook for 15 minutes.
4. Add the milk and heat through.
5. Blend and serve! Or wait to cool and pop in the fridge for lunches over the next couple of days.
