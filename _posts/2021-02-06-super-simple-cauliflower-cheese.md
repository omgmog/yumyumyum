Another one of my baby's absolute favourites. I often make a huge portion and freeze half for my future lazy-can't-be-bothered-to-cook-tonight self.

As she's just a littlie I use whole milk but I use very strong cheddar because you can use less for more flavour. I realise not all children go for strong cheese but my daughter devours anything vaguely cheesy as if she hasn't been fed for days.

*Ingredients*\
1 head of cauliflower\
50g unsalted butter\
50g flour\
200ml whole milk\
200ml low salt vegetable stock\
60g vintage cheddar (roughly - I just grate the cheese over the top of the dish without weighing anything out)

*Method*

1. Preheat the oven to 180c.

2. Chop up the cauliflower and boil for 5 minutes. Drain and tip into a lasagne dish.

3. Melt the butter in a pan over a low to medium heat and stir in the flour. 

4. I normally combine the milk and the stock into the same measuring jug because it saves on washing up. Gradually add this to the butter and flour mix (the roux), making sure that the mixture is bubbling before adding more each time.

5. Tip the white sauce over the cauliflower and give it a bit of a mix to make sure it's completely covered.

6. Grate the cheese over the top.

7. Put it in the oven for half an hour until the dish is brown and bubbling. Serve with homemade potato wedges and some other vegetables.
