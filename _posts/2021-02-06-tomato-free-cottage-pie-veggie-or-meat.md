There was a time when we couldn't give our daughter tomato in any form. This presented a huge challenge for me as I normally use tomatoes as a base for most meals. 

This is my answer for tomato (and garlic) free cottage pie! 

You can use meat or veggie mince. This was actually originally designed for veggie mine - you don't need to add so much flavour for meat although it doesn't do any harm.

I also used to add peas but my daughter can't have those either! Basically add whatever veg you want.

Serves 4 adults and 2 tiny people (we eat half and freeze half)

*Ingredients*\
500g potato\
Vegetable oil\
1 onion, chopped\
500g mince (veggie or meat)\
2 carrots, peeled and chopped\
Sweetcorn (a good shake from a frozen bag)\
1 tsp dried rosemary\
1 bay leaf\
1 tsp marmite\
1 low salt vegetable (or beef) stock cube\
Whole milk, slug\
60g strong cheddar (or enough to cover the pie)

*Method*\
1. Preheat your oven to 180c

2. Chop your potatoes and boil them from cold water for 20 minutes. I keep the skin on.

3. Fry the onion in oil over a low heat for around 3 minutes.

4. Add your mince and fry until browned (NOTE: cooking instructions may vary for vegetarian meat. Just read the label for guidance.)

5. Add the rosemary, bay leaf, marmite and stock cube and stir. Pour in boiling water until just covering the mixture.

6. Add the carrot and sweetcorn. Bring to a simmer.

7. Drain and mash your potato with a slug of whole milk.

8. Transfer the mince mixture to a casserole dish and spoon and smooth the potato on top. 

9. Grate the cheese over the top.

10. Put in the oven for 30 minutes until the pie is bubbling and golden brown on top.

NOTE: You could also add a tablespoon or so of my tomato-free pasta sauce. You can find the recipe here.
