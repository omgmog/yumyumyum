This was the first time trying flaxseed as an egg replacement and it was so easy and worked great! I'm not sure why it took me so long. I think I was a bit nervous about it but now I've popped that cherry I need to go forth and use it in everything. Next up will be cakes!

Anyway back to the recipe at hand. This is a scaled back, simplified version to satisfy baby pallettes but actually it was very flavoursome and doesn't need anything extra!

### Ingredients

- 500g sweet potato
- 4 florets broccoli
- 125g mozzarella
- 1tbsp flaxseed
- 2 slices of bread (I used seeded)
- Vegetable oil

### Method

1. Peel and chop the weet potato. Add to a pan of cold water and boil for fifteen minutes.
2. Meanwhile mix our flaxseed with 3 tablespoons of water. Set aside.
3. Boil your broccoli for 5 minutes. Set aside and once cooled chop up into small chunks.
4. Grate the mozzarella.
5. Whizz your bread into crumbs.
6. Once the potato is cooked mash it up.
7. Combine the potato, flaxseed, broccoli, mozzarella and half the breadcrumbs. 
8. Scoop up the mixture into burger sized patties and roll them in the rest of the breadcrumbs. I made 9 - 4 each for the adults and one for the baby.
9. Heat a pan with oil and fry the patties for 6 minutes on each side.
10. Serve! We had it with the rest of the head of broccoli and sweet chilli sauce (the sauce was for the adults only)

#### NOTE
This recipe would work with lots of different types of veg. I will add some sweetcorn next time.
